# SV-Learn Extension (Tentative Title)
Essentially an extension of previous research done on SVLearn to now start generalizing the algorithm to the full SVD as well as different sized matrices.

## Note
*(Reformat later)*
Add folders, 'data', 'data/cifar-10','data/Matrix_gens/(cifar_10_data | cifar_10_data_2 | UCI_data)'
- OR - change the directories within the scripts as they used predetermined local directories
